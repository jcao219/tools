Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.  
Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, 
by definition, not smart enough to debug it.

OCaml is a very sexy European car. It's not quite as fast as C, but it 
never breaks down, so you end up going further in less time. However, 
because it's French, none of the controls are in the usual places.

Haskell is not really a car; it's an abstract machine in which you give 
a detailed description of what the process of driving would be like if 
you were to do it. You have to put the abstract machine inside another 
(concrete) machine in order to actually do any driving. You're not supposed 
to ask how the concrete machine works. There is also a way to take multiple 
abstract machines and make a single abstract machine, which you can then 
give to the concrete machine to make multiple trips one after another.
